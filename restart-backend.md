# CORS Issue Fixed - Restart Required

## Problem Solved âœ…
The "405 Method Not Allowed" error was caused by missing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration in the FastAPI backend.

## What Was Added
Added CORS middleware to allow requests from the Next.js frontend:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://localhost:3001", 
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3001",
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## Next Steps
**You need to restart the FastAPI backend for changes to take effect:**

1. **Stop the current backend** (Ctrl+C in the terminal running the backend)

2. **Restart the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Verify it's working:**
   - Backend should start on http://localhost:8000
   - You should see "Application startup complete" message
   - No more CORS errors when making requests from frontend

## Test the Integration
After restarting the backend:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/ai-console
2. Select an alloy grade
3. Click "Run AI Analysis"
4. Should now work without CORS errors!

The CORS middleware will now properly handle the OPTIONS preflight requests that browsers send before making actual API calls.
